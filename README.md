# Color Quantization

We are going to use Vector Quantization method to reduce the number of colors required to show the image without compromising the overall picture quality.

We will be using the K-means algorithm to divide total pixels into 64 color clusters.

A single byte, up to 256 colors can be addressed, whereas an RGB encoding requires 3 bytes per pixel.
